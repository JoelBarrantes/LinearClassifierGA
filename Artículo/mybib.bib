abstract = {Multilayered feedforward neural networks possess a number of properties which make them particu-larly suited to complex pattern classification prob-lems. However, their application to some real-world problems has been hampered by the lack of a training algonthm which reliably finds a nearly globally optimal set of weights in a relatively short time. Genetic algorithms are a class of optimiza-tion procedures which are good at exploring a large and complex space in an intelligent way to find values close to the global optimum. Hence, they are well suited to the problem of training feedfor-ward networks. In this paper, we describe a set of experiments performed on data from a sonar image classification problem. These experiments both 1) illustrate the improvements gained by using a ge-netic algorithm rather than backpropagation and 2) chronicle the evolution of the performance of the genetic algorithm as we added more and more domain-specific knowledge into it.},
